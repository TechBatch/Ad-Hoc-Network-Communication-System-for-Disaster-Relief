First week of the semester. Meeting with DS coordinator.

## Week 2 Feb. 26-Mar. 3

* I started to code the search and rescue algorithm in C++.
* I created a new repository for the algorithm, and I also updated my progress in read-me file in the repository. https://github.com/eozkaynar/Search-and-Rescue-Algorithm

    ### The progress in the code is :

        *Done:* 

        * Graph structure is created.
        * Grid is created.
        * Neighbors vector is added.
        * Tile status change function added.

        *What will be done:*

        * Add an enum class for Base and target tiles.
        * Grid partitioning.
        * Partition search for one mu.
        * Dijkstra's algorithm.

* I also created a new organization in the GitHub to share all codes  and documents with team members.

* To design our mobile unit and print it from 3D printer, I search some Fusion360 tutorials
