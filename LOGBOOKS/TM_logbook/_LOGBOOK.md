## Week 1  

First week of the semester. Meeting with DS coordinator.

## Week 2 Feb. 26-Mar. 3
This week I work on new component selection and ordering. We had multiple problems with our motors, batteries, and motor drivers that prevented our mobile units from making perfect turns. Thus, I did some research on the suitable battery, driver, and motor combinations for our application and did the necessary calculations to choose the type and rpm of the motor, voltage, and mAh of the battery and suitable driver. Also, at the end of the week, we decided to use omni wheels and we ordered all the chosen components.
Secondly, I choose motors that are suitable for encoder connections and external encoders are available. We decided to buy those external encoders and use a PID algorithm with an encoder for backup if our new components won't work as we expected. Thus I also worked on those algorithms.
