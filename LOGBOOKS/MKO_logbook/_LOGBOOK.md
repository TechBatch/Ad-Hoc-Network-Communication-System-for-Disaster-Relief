# Ad-Hoc-Network-Communication-System-for-Disaster-Relief
Kemal's LogBook

## Week 1  

First week of the semester. Meeting with DS coordinator.

## Week 2 Feb. 26-Mar. 3

* I started coding the communication architecture in C++ and I almost finished the header file for the main code.
* I also tried to find a proper communication protocol to transmit longer messages but I did not find any that will be suitable for us. Therefore, I decided to use NEC protocol. However, I wil use this protocol in different way which I planned. It will be mixture of TCP and UDP protocoles.
    ### Progress in the Code
        #### Done:
          * Message definitions are done 
          * Necessary function declarations are done
        #### Will be done:
          * Function implementations will be done
          * Tasks and semaphores will be arranged
          * Structures will be declared
          * Movement functions will be integrated
